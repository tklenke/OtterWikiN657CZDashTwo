# N657CZ Dash Two: Digital Maintenance Manual

This repository contains the structured technical data, inspection procedures, and maintenance manuals (-2) for the **N657CZ** aircraft. 

Unlike a traditional build log, this is a living **Maintenance Manual** designed to provide immediate access to technical specifications and standardized procedures for continued airworthiness.

## ⚙️ Why Markdown for Maintenance?
Traditional formats like Word or Google Docs fail the "Hangar Test." This manual uses Plain Text Markdown because:
* **Portability:** Access technical specs on a tablet, phone, or laptop without needing proprietary software or high-speed internet.
* **Clarity:** Plain text forces a focus on content over formatting, ensuring that critical torque values and clearances are easy to find.
* **Longevity:** These files are future-proof. They will remain readable as long as computers exist, ensuring the aircraft's technical history is never lost to file-format obsolescence.

## 🛠 The Advantage of Git Version Control
Maintenance manuals require strict "Revision Control." Using Git provides:
* **Immutable History:** Every update to a procedure is logged. You can see exactly how a maintenance task evolved over the life of the aircraft.
* **Diff Tracking:** If a specification changes, Git highlights exactly what was modified (e.g., changing a 25-hour inspection to a 50-hour) so nothing is missed.
* **Reliable Backups:** The manual exists on the aircraft's local server ("Hanger") and is mirrored here on GitHub, ensuring redundant access to safety-critical data.

## 🚀 How to Fork This for Your Aircraft
Other builders or owners can use this repository as a framework for their own aircraft-specific maintenance manual.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/tklenke/OtterWikiN657CZDashTwo.git](https://github.com/tklenke/OtterWikiN657CZDashTwo.git) N-NUMBER-Manual

```

### 2. Standardize Your Manual

* Navigate to the `repository` folder to find the Markdown source files.
* Replace N657CZ-specific data with your own airframe and engine specifications.
* Organise files by system (e.g., `Airframe.md`, `Avionics.md`, `Engine_IO-360.md`).

### 3. Deployment

This repository is designed to be served via **OtterWiki**, providing a searchable, web-based "Wiki" interface in the hangar while maintaining a professional Git backend for revision management.
