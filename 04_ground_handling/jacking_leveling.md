# Jacking_Leveling

## 1. Jacking Instructions

### Structural Requirements

* **Load Bearing Points:** Only jack the aircraft under the **center section spar** or the **wing spar caps**.
* **Prohibited Areas:** **Do NOT** apply jack pressure to the wing or strake skins, as they are not designed for point-loading and may delaminate or crush.
* **Protection:** Always use a protective pad (such as 2 lb. density Styrofoam or a padded wood block) between the jack and the spar to distribute the load and protect the finish.

### Recommended Methods

#### The "Nose-Pivot" Method

*This method is designed for aircraft equipped with electric nose gear.*

1. **Lower the Nose:** Retract the nose gear until the nose is on or near the ground.
2. **Position Supports:** Place two tall sawhorses under the center spar. The supports should be approximately 4" lower than the spar height in this nose-down attitude.
3. **Apply Padding:** Place a 4" block of 2 lb. styrofoam on top of each support.
4. **Lift:** Extend the electric nose gear. The aircraft will pivot on the padded supports, lifting the main gear off the ground.

#### Standard Jacking

1. **Positioning:** Place jacks at the end of the center spar or just outboard of the wing mount bolts.
2. **Weight Shift:** Be aware that moving the jacks further outboard on the wing spar will increase the weight load on the nose gear.

## 2. Leveling Instructions

### Longitudinal (Pitch) Leveling

1. **Reference Point:** Use the top of the fuselages **longerons** as the primary leveling reference.
2. **Adjustment:** Raise or lower the nose gear until the longerons are level relative to the horizon.
3. **Verification:** A digital level or a bubble level placed on the longeron in the cockpit area is the standard verification method.

### Lateral (Roll) Leveling

1. **Reference Point:** Use the center section spar or the engine mount extrusions.
2. **Adjustment:** Ensure the jacking supports or sawhorses are of equal height. If the floor is uneven, shim the base of the jacks—do not shim between the spar and the foam pad.
3. **Verification:** Place a level across the center section spar to ensure the wings are even.

> **Note:** While some builders consider installing permanent jack point "pockets" on the aft face of the spar, the standard practice of jacking anywhere along the spar with suitable padding is sufficient and preferred for most maintenance tasks.
